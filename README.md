# Rosé Pine for DOOM Emacs
All natural pine, faux fur and a bit of soho vibes for the classy minimalist.

# How to install
1. Clone or download this repo
2. `make install` to copy the themes to `~/.config/.doom/themes/`
3. Update your `config.el`
    - `(setq doom-theme 'doom-rose-pine)`
4. `doom/reload-theme` _(this doesn't seem to work for me though, you can restart emacs instead)_

# Themes provided
1. Rosé Pine
2. Rosé Pine Moon
3. Rosé Pine Dawn
